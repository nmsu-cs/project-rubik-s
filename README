This program emulates and solves a Rubik's cube.
You will need python libraries installed, please install them using the following command:
    If using Python3 or greater, use:

        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    If using Python2, use 

        pip install -r requirements.txt

    If using a third party Virtual environment, such as Anaconda, you may install
    using the environments package manager commands, for example with Anaconda:

        conda install -r requirements.txt

Note: The libraries required for this are:
    pillow (PIL - Python Imaging Library)
    JPype1 (jpype - Python to Java bridge)
    Tkinter (Tkinter - built-in python GUI library)
    os (built-in Operating System library)
    subprocess - built in console command library
    csv - built in CSV file management library

To Run from IDE:
Once you have the libraries installed, Open the "Main.py" file in your IDE (I use VSCode) and run the file.

To Run from Terminal:
Navigate to the project folder in the terminal.
depending on your python version, you can run the program by entering:
    python Main.py
    or
    python3 Main.py
