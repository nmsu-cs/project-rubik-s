This program emulates and solves a Rubik's cube. 
To build this program, open the folder in an IDE, I use VS Code.
You will need python libraries installed, please install them using the following command:
    If using Python3 or greater, use:

        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    If using Python2, use 

        pip install -r requirements.txt

    If using a third party Virtual environment, such as Anaconda, you may install
    using the environments package manager commands, for example with Anaconda:

        conda install -r requirements.txt

Note: The libraries required for this are:
    pillow (PIL - Python Imaging Library)
    JPype1 (jpype - Python to Java bridge)
    Tkinter (Tkinter - built-in python GUI library)
    os (built-in Operating System library)
    subprocess - built in console command library
